## Real-time Reporting and Analytics

Monitor testing in real time via dashboards and APIs. Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline for automated insights.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/tests/123/reports', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data.bugsFound); // e.g., 42
  ```
  ```python
  import requests
  response = requests.get(
    'https://api.example.com/v1/tests/123/reports',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'}
  )
  data = response.json()
  print(data['bugsFound'])  # e.g., 42
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="bugsFound" field-type="integer" required="true">
  Total bugs detected in the cycle.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="coverage" field-type="object">
  Device and OS coverage stats.
</ResponseField>

## Customizable Testing Cycles

Adapt cycles to your sprint length and risk profile. Use exploratory testing for new features or regression suites for stability.

<Expandable title="Advanced Cycle Configuration" default-open="false">

Configure via API or dashboard:

<ParamField path="cycleType" param-type="string" required="true">
  Options: `exploratory`, `regression`, `smoke`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="durationHours" param-type="integer">
  Cycle length in hours (default: 48).
</ParamField>

Example payload:

```json
{
  "cycleType": "exploratory",
  "durationHours": 24,
  "platforms": ["android", "ios"]
}
```

</Expandable>

<Callout kind="success">
  Combine features for end-to-end QA: Launch crowdtesting, add managed oversight, track via APIs, and iterate cycles.
